I am taking ferrous fumarate on prescription from Acklam Medical Centre (AMC), which produces dark stool.
The past 12 days I have had very bad abdominal pain each morning after passing a vast amount of dark stool. This is consistent with some of listed possible side-effects.
The Rapid Diagnostic Centre has advised I should immediately stop taking ferrous fumarate and make an appointment with AMC about changing the prescription.

symptoms:
lower abdomen, may be best described as burning pain

weight loss:
about 4 kg

what else:
Also have pain in the right side for 13 days.  This pain is already there each morning before passing dark stool.
Although the abdominal pain is separate, the two add to increase a very strong combined pain.
