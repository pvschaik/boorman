1 20 March, Alison Matti prescribed me ear drops to use for one week against a pain in the right ear.
I completed the course, but the pain continues, especially in the morning.
In addition, it seems that my hearing with the right ear has vastly reduced.
Can this be further examined?

Ear spray cured the infection, but not the pain
Ear drops did not cur the pain

2 Alison Matti had also confirmed that I could do a self-referral for a free NHS hearing test with a local optician.  I found out and reported last week at the reception that this free test is not available in this area.  The receptionist confirmed that therefore a referral would be made for me from AMC to the audiology department at JCUH for my hearing test.  Could you please confirm that this referral has been made?
