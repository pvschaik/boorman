I have what seems to be inflammation on the outside and around the chin for about 4 weeks.
At the chemist's recommendation, I bought Aqueous Calamine Cream and Cetirizine dihydrochoride and used this for four days. There seems to be no meaningful improvement.
The chemist now recommends a stronger medicine, probably steroid cream, but this is only available on prescription.
