Hearing has become difficult
difficulty following a conversation in group
need to ask people to speak louder during a call
More difficulty hearing when listening to the radio
pain in my ear after listening
Requestears examined and syringed if necessary
2019 hearing clinic in JCUH
Based on the results I was given an appointment to get a hearing aid
However, at the appointment the recommendation was not to get a hearing aid
This is because the benefits would not outweigh the effort to use an aid
