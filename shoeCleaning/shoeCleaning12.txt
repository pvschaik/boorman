1. Leather Shoes (Genuine & Faux)
Why Special Care? Leather is sensitive to moisture and can crack if over-wetted.

Steps:
Wipe with a damp cloth – Mix mild soap with warm water and lightly wipe the interior using a soft cloth. Avoid soaking the leather.
Disinfect – Use a cloth dampened with equal parts white vinegar and water to wipe the inside. This removes bacteria and odors.
Dry thoroughly – Stuff with paper towels to absorb moisture and let them air dry (avoid direct sunlight).
Deodorize – Sprinkle baking soda inside overnight, then shake it out the next day.

2. Suede or Nubuck Shoes
Why Special Care? Suede is delicate and can be damaged by excess moisture.

Steps:
Remove loose dirt – Use a soft suede brush to loosen any debris inside.
Spot clean gently – Lightly dampen a cloth with white vinegar and wipe the interior. Avoid excess moisture.
Disinfect & deodorize – Sprinkle baking soda inside and let it sit overnight, then brush or shake it out.
Air dry – Let shoes dry naturally in a ventilated area.
✦ Tip: If odor is strong, place dry tea bags inside overnight to absorb smells.

3. Mesh or Fabric Shoes (Sneakers, Trainers, Canvas, etc.)
Why Special Care? Mesh absorbs sweat and dirt easily, so it needs deeper cleaning.

Steps:
Brush off loose dirt – Use a soft brush or vacuum attachment.
Hand wash inside – Mix warm water with mild detergent and use a soft brush or sponge to scrub inside.
Deep disinfecting – Use a mix of water and white vinegar (1:1) or rubbing alcohol to wipe the interior.
Remove odors – Sprinkle baking soda inside and let sit overnight. Shake it out in the morning.
Dry completely – Stuff with paper towels and air dry (never use direct heat, like a hairdryer).
✦ Tip: You can also place dryer sheets inside overnight for extra freshness.

4. Patent Leather Shoes
Why Special Care? Patent leather has a shiny, coated surface that can get sticky.

Steps:
Wipe inside with soapy water – Use a damp microfiber cloth with mild soap.
Remove stickiness – Mix equal parts water and white vinegar to wipe the inside.
Disinfect & deodorize – Wipe with rubbing alcohol and let dry.
Keep fresh – Use a few drops of essential oil inside to maintain a pleasant smell.
✦ Tip: Store with silica gel packs inside to prevent moisture buildup.

Alternatively, wipe the inside with a cloth dampened with white vinegar or rubbing alcohol for disinfecting.
5. Spot Treat with Hydrogen Peroxide (if needed)
If there are stains or bacteria buildup, lightly dab the inside with hydrogen peroxide using a cloth.
6. Dry Properly
Stuff the shoes with paper towels or dry cloths to absorb moisture.
Let them air dry in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight to prevent damage.
