Yesterday, my physiotherapist advised that I should see a GP about what seems to be inflammation on the outside and around the chin, now for about 6 weeks, and also the nose and the forehead.  The chin and especially the nose are painful.
At the chemist's recommendation, I bought Aqueous Calamine Cream and Cetirizine dihydrochoride and used this for more than two weeks. There seems to be no meaningful improvement.
The chemist now recommends a stronger medicine, probably steroid cream, but this is only available on prescription. 
Hydrocortisone/steroid cream was recommended.

possible trigger: physiotherapy exercise lying on the front. The chin then touches the ground.
