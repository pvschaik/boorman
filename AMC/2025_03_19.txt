5 March, I was prescribed Otomize ear spray against a painful ear infection.
I have used the spray for 14 days, but the pain continues.
I am reporting this now, as Cohens pharmacist suggested that I should wait 14 days before reporting.
My request is a review appointment with a clinician as soon as possible.
Also as before:
difficulty following group conversation
need to ask people to speak louder during a call
difficulty hearing when listening to the radio
pain in my ear after listening
