Hearing test 5 April 25 at SpecSavers.
I had discomfort in my right ear after the test.
The audiologist recommends a hearing aid, but first wants my right ear checked by an ENT doctor before proceeding with the hearing aid.
Also discomfort in right ear when/after walking in cold weather.
Request: referral to an ENT specialist.

What treatment did you receive previously for your ear(s) and did it work?
Ear drops; after a course of treatment the infection cleared.
