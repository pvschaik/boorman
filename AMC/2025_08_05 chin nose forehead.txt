28 July, my physiotherapist advised that I should see a GP about what seems to be inflammation on the outside and around my dark red chin, now for about 7 weeks, and also the nose and the forehead.  The chin is especially painful with physiotherapy exercise lying on the front (when the chin touches the ground) and with shaving. The pain has since spread also to the inside (mouth). Also continual discomfort in the background.

At the chemist's recommendation, I bought Aqueous Calamine Cream and Cetirizine Dihydrochoride and used this for more than two weeks. No improvement.
The chemist then recommended a stronger medicine, probably steroid cream on prescription. 
In response to my first e-Consult, AMC recommended hydrocortisone/steroid cream, but this was dismissed at my in-person consultation at AMC 29 July.
I have taken the penicillin prescription, but the symptoms have worsened.
My dentist has not been able to identify the cause.
