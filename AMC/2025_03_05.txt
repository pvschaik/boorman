I have been oiling both ears three times a day, as advised.
1 Every time I oil the right ear the pain in the right ear gets worse.
2 Now even when I take a shower the pain in the right ear gets worse.
I have therefore suspended oiling the right ear.
When I listen to the radio, after a few minutes I can hear less/need to turn up the volume and feel discomfort in the right ear.
I would like to have my right ear examined at the practice.
