An employee on the final salary Teachers' Pension Scheme has been off sick for 6 months with full pay.
After 6 months their pay will go to half pay.
Will their pension be based on their full pay or based on their half pay?
If the answer is half pay should they have retired before the change from full pay to half pay?
