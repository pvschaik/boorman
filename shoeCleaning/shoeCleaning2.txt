Cleaning the inside of your shoes without a washing machine requires a few simple steps. Here’s how to do it thoroughly:

What You’ll Need:
Mild detergent or dish soap
Baking soda
White vinegar or rubbing alcohol
Hydrogen peroxide (optional)
A soft brush or old toothbrush
A clean cloth or sponge
Paper towels
Essential oils (optional, for freshness)

Step-by-Step Cleaning Process:
1. Remove Insoles and Laces
If your shoes have removable insoles, take them out.
Wash the insoles separately using mild detergent and warm water. Scrub gently and let them air dry.
2. Dry Brush or Vacuum
Use a soft brush or vacuum with an attachment to remove loose dirt and debris inside the shoes.
3. Clean the Interior with Soap and Water
Mix warm water with a small amount of mild detergent.
Dip a sponge or cloth into the solution and wipe the inside of the shoes.
Use an old toothbrush to scrub stubborn areas.
4. Deodorize with Baking Soda or Vinegar
Sprinkle baking soda inside the shoes and let it sit overnight to absorb odors. Shake it out the next day.
Alternatively, wipe the inside with a cloth dampened with white vinegar or rubbing alcohol for disinfecting.
5. Spot Treat with Hydrogen Peroxide (if needed)
If there are stains or bacteria buildup, lightly dab the inside with hydrogen peroxide using a cloth.
6. Dry Properly
Stuff the shoes with paper towels or dry cloths to absorb moisture.
Let them air dry in a well-ventilated area. Avoid direct sunlight to prevent damage.
7. Freshen Up
Add a few drops of essential oil to the insoles before placing them back.
Use a shoe deodorizing spray if needed.
Bonus Tip:
For extra freshness, store your shoes with dryer sheets or silica gel packs inside when not in use.
