PAIN IN RIGHT EAR
Discomfort in my right ear continues. The audiologist has advised that this needs to be investigated by an ear specialist before I can get a hearing aid.
In a recent E-Consult, Dr de Jongh has confirmed that my referral to an ear specialist will be made when the audiologist's letter has been received.
I handed the audiologist's letter to Martin Smith Thursday 24 April.  He kindly photocopied the letter.
Could you please confirm that my referral has now been made?
Otherwise could you let me know when my referral will be made and confirm this when this has been done?


Both ears were syringed 12 April  2025.
