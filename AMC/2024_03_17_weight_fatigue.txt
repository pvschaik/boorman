At my appointment with the emergency department at JCUH (15/3/2025), my recent unexplained weight loss - as measured at JCUH - and fatigue were noted.
The emergency doctor recommended that I report these to you for your attention at Acklam Medical Centre.
The emergency doctor mentioned that he will also mention this in his letter from this appointment, which you may have already received.
I reported tiredness in my eConsult report 30/12/2024.
