Discomfort/pain on the skin of the very far bottom of the anus since yesterday/3 April. Because of this it is difficult to sit for some time.
Some minor discomfort in previous days.
Yesterday put on some moisturising lotion on two occasions.  After that the pain was very bad, both times.
Saw a pharmacist at the chemist this morning.  They advised to contact a general practice and have this thoroughly physically examined.  From this any treatment would be decided.

Cannot see because this is on the skin of the very far bottom of the anus.
