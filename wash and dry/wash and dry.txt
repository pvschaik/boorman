2-bedroom bungalow, 1 living room, 1 small kitchen, 1 small bathroom, 1 very small entrance hall, 1 very small internal hall between bedrooms, living room and bath room.
Currently the washer/dryver is in the kitchen.
How can we reorganise/redesign machine washing and drying for this bungalow, while avoiding damp?
Where to place the washer/dryer?
Where to dry clothes after drying in the machine?
