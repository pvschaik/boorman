I have abdominal pain since the start of 2025 and had consultations with AMC clinicians.

Colonoscopy April 2025.
Have received and taken different prescriptions, currently one-off mebeverine hydrochloride; with MH, the pain has reduced, but not disappeared. Have once renewed the prescription myself.  Last month, the receptionist recommended I complete an eConsult.
