Increased hearing loss
Impossible to follow a conversation in group/meals, difficulty hearing calls and radio
2019 hearing clinic in JCUH. Based on the results I was given an appointment to get a hearing aid; eventually it was decided not to get a hearing aid.
However, hearing has got much worse.  
Request: appointment with ENT/JCUH to assess hearing loss

Alison Matti has examined my ears recently and has my preference.
