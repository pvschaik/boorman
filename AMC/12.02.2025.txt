1 The physiotherapy service at One Life has discharged me today because physiotherapy has not worked.
They advised that you will receive an electronic discharge letter today or tomorrow.
Have continuous bad knee/calf/upper leg pain in the right leg even at night when taking the prescribed codeine.
2 Continue to have heart palpitations.  I reported this several times before.
