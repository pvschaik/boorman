Over the past two weeks, both itching in the groin and incontinence have much increased, despite good hygiene.
The itching has now become a burning sensation and is temporarily somewhat relieved after passing water.
Itching seems to be less when wearing washed underwear, but this is only temporary.
The urine seems to be thicker than normal.
Could this be a urinary Tract or bladder infection? Test for infection?
Itching in the feet has also increased.


Measures taken: changing incontinence pads twice a day; good hygiene.

Symptoms since December 2024. Over the past two weeks, both itching in the groin and incontinence have much increased, despite good hygiene.

Additional: sometimes there is some leakage of urine in very small quantities within a few minutes of passing water.  I do not notice the leak itself, but feel it when a very small leak has arrived on a lower leg or on a foot.
