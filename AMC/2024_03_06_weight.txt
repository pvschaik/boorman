At my appointment with the cardiologist today (6/3/2025), it was noted that my weight was 59.3 kg.
Early 2025 at AMC the weight was about 64 kg.
The cardiologist recommended that I report this to you, also considering my relative low iron level.
The cardiologist mentioned that she will also mention this in her letter from this appointment.
I reported tiredness in my eConsult report 30/12/2024.
